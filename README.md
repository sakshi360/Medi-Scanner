## Inspiration  
The trouble to enter medicine names manually in online medicine booking applications and also adding prescriptions to justify inspired us to build the solution. This is a pervasive problem for most of us. So we propose to save your precious time by providing you with an application which can list and book all your medicines prescribed by just uploading the prescription into the application.  

## Solution
This is an application where user can upload his/her prescription from his camera and get all the details of diagnosis,treatment, medications, tests etc. He/She can also book the medicines/tests through the application without having to explicitly search for the medicines.

•	This solution uses react native  for mobile.  
•	For backend it uses AWS services like Textract, AWS Comprehend Medical, SQS, SNS, Lambda, Dynamo DB, API Gateway. Please refer Mural [link]
